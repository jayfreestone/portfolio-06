I’m a front-end developer living and working in East London. I have a degree in English literature, but didn’t fancy working at Starbucks, so taught myself web development instead.

I currently lead the front-end team at [Browser London](https://www.browserlondon.com/) where I help build enterprise web-apps. Prior to that I managed the digital side of [Overture London’s](https://overture.london/) design projects as well as the setup and maintenance of hosting/deployment infrastructure.

Despite it originally being my escape hatch, I love what I do.
