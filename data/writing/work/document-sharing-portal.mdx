I was responsible for designing and building a pattern library for a document sharing portal built on Symfony. Each pattern was developed in Pattern-lab (using Twig) then directly integrated into the production application. This ‘living’ pattern-library continues to grow and evolve alongside the application, now encompassing complex UI patterns such as an ‘inbox’ style workflow. Built with Twig, vanilla JS and SASS.
