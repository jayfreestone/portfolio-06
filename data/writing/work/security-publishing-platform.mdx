Working in conjunction with our in-house UX designer and backend engineering team, I designed and developed an isomorphic frontend for a risk-analysis publishing platform. Features included geographic risk reporting; PDF generation; an interactive WebGL map; a bespoke content-builder for editorials; a custom analytics micro-service; and an administrative control panel for resellers. Built using React, Redux and Typescript, the application also takes a functional approach through extensive use of Ramada and Recompose.
