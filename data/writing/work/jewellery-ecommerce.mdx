Using a custom WordPress REST API implementation and React/Redux, I designed and developed a jewellery e-commerce application for [The Moon up Above](https://www.themoonupabove.co.uk). Bespoke inventory management was built to avoid the overkill of a third-party plugin, with payments processed directly using Stripe. Weâ€™re currently scoping out a new custom backend built on Laravel, as well as a revised isomorphic frontend.
